## Important:
Scholarly is used without proxy. Google scholar does not like bots, which means that sometimes your ip can be temporarily blocked (maybe several minutes). So idealy you want to set up your own proxy. Block criteria unclear. If it happened you can temporarily use vpn. I suppose the number of queries is limited for some period of time. Nonetheless, script was successfully tested for 25 publications several times.
